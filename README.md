# Here’s an expanded and detailed README for the backend of your fitness project:
Fitness Tracker Backend
Project Overview

This is the backend of the Fitness Tracker project, which provides a RESTful API for storing and managing users’ fitness data, including workout logs, diet plans, and progress tracking. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js and integrates with MongoDB Atlas for data persistence. Authentication and authorization are handled using JWT (JSON Web Token), ensuring secure access to user data.

The backend handles user registration, login, and CRUD operations for managing workouts and diet logs. It serves as the backbone of the Fitness Tracker, supporting frontend communication with API endpoints.
Tech Stack

  Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
  Express.js: A minimalist framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js.
  MongoDB Atlas: A cloud-based NoSQL database service to store user data and fitness logs.
  Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to interact with the database.
  JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure user authentication and session handling.
  bcryptjs: A library for hashing and securely storing passwords.
  CORS: Middleware to enable cross-origin requests, allowing communication between the frontend and backend.

Key Features

   User Authentication & Authorization:
        Registration and login system using JWT for secure authentication.
        Password hashing using bcryptjs for secure storage.
        Token-based authorization to protect private routes.

  Workout and Diet Management:
        API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting workout and diet entries.
        Users can track their daily workouts and diets with timestamps.
        Data is stored in a structured MongoDB database.

  Secure Data Handling:
        Authentication required for sensitive operations (such as viewing or modifying user data).
        Middleware for validating JWT tokens in requests to protect routes.

  MongoDB Integration:
        Mongoose is used for schema-based interaction with MongoDB Atlas.
        Data models for user, workout, and diet logs.
